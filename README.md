# Additional functions
MVVM is great, right? So why don't use messaging (for example: trigger some adjustments in the UI without adding more variables, right from the code-behind? Or shouting variable contents through the application?). 
You can implement it easily, but why do you want to re-invent the wheel, if you can use my pre-built messenger. It is located in the 'messaging' branch!

It's all that easy!
